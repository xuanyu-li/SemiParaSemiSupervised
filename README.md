# dplqr
This is the public code of the paper "Neural Networks for Partially Linear Quantile Regression" by Qixian Zhong and Jane-Ling Wang (2023).

To get started, you first need to install python package PyTorch (https://pytorch.org), torchtuples (https://pypi.org/project/torchtuples) and R package plaqr (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plaqr). 
- demo.ipynb: Jupyter file to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed DPLQR.
- dqAux.py: auxiliary functions for the DPLQR.
- plaqr.R: R code to implement PLAQR.
- plot.R: R code to plot confidence intervals and prediction errors.
- data: Concrete Compressive Strength Data Set (concrete.csv), available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu.
